# ðŸ“Š Dynamic Electricity Prices with Solar and Storage 

Visualizing daily electricity prices and planning **storage** with **solar** power production and **consumption** usage:
- **Why?** Dynamic price will be a hot subject in the future with increasing solar capacity distributed in the grid and its intermittent nature. 
- **POC?** An proof of concept of Studer (best inverters in the world!) next3 hybrid inverter control done with the Vario dynamic price of the DSO Groupe-E

# SolarSystem Simulation

This module simulates a solar energy system, including PV production, battery storage behavior, and grid interaction. It is built for systems like the Studer *next3* and can be used for both basic and advanced simulations using time-series data.

## Features

- PV system modeling with orientation and slope
- Battery storage with efficiency and SOC tracking
- Inverter limits and grid export constraints
- Simulation of daily energy flow
- Cost evaluation based on grid usage and energy injection
- Visualizations using matplotlib

## Installation

Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```

## Getting Started

```python
from solarsystem import SolarSystem

# Create a new system
sys = SolarSystem(owner_name="Alice", adress="123 Solar Street")

# Load profiles from CSV
sys.load_csv_data_for_simulation("data.csv", "Load_kW", "Solar_kW", timestep=0.25)

# Run simulation
sys.run_storage_simulation()

# Display results
sys.display_storage_simulation()
```

## Class: SolarSystem
