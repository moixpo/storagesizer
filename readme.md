# ðŸ“Š Streamlit Battery Simulation Demo

This project is a **Streamlit** application that demonstrates the impact of battery size on different simulated indicators (autonomy, self-consumption ratio, etc.).

The user can:
- Select a battery capacity with a **slider**,
- Run a **simulation** (simplified example),
- View the **complete history** of results,
- Plot a **graph** of self-consumption ratio as a function of battery size,
- Reset the history with a **Reset** button.

## ðŸš€ Installation

1. **Clone** or download the project  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-account/streamlit-battery-simulation.git
