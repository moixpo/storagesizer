# 📊 Streamlit Battery Simulation Demo

This project is a **Streamlit** application that demonstrates the impact of battery size on different simulated indicators (autonomy, self-consumption ratio, etc.). It includes the simulation of a lot of cases that can happen in the real world: grid feeding limitation, need of a backup, need of peak shaving...

The user can:
- Select a battery capacity with a **slider**, and many others.
- Run a **simulation** (simplified example),
- View the **complete history** of results,
- Build a customized **graph** of various indicators (self-consumption ratio, bill, ...) as a function of available settings (battery size, scaling the solar, chose different dataset,...)
- Reset the history with a **Reset** button.
- And even make nice **interactive 3D plots**

MIT + buy me a coffee ;-)

The value is a little bit in having the code, and a lot in the ability to apply it to a real case for an customer. Please contact me for developpements/consulting.
