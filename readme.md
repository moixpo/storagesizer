# 📊 Streamlit Battery Simulation Demo

This project is a **Streamlit** application that demonstrates the impact of battery size on different simulated indicators (autonomy, self-consumption ratio, etc.). It includes the simulation of a lot of cases that can happen in the real world: grid feeding limitation, need of a backup, need of peak shaving...

The user can:
- Select a battery capacity with a **slider**,
- Run a **simulation** (simplified example),
- View the **complete history** of results,
- Plot a **graph** of self-consumption ratio as a function of battery size,
- Reset the history with a **Reset** button.



## 🚀 Deployement
This can be directly used here: https://batterysizer.streamlit.app/



## 🛠 Installation

1. **Clone** or download the project  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-account/streamlit-battery-simulation.git
   cd streamlit-battery-simulation

## License

MIT + buy me a coffee ;-)

The value is a little bit in having the code, and a lot in the ability to apply it to a real case for an customer. Please contact me for developpements/consulting.
